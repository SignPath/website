		<h2>Most IT organizations don't have a secure code signing process</h2>
		<p>
			In times of growing cyber security breaches, platform vendors and customers require all deployed applications to be digitally signed. Code signing is the only way to guarantee that software has not been modified by a third party. The corporate solutions of SignPath enable DevOps teams to seamlessly integrate code-signing into their development lifecycle and empowers InfoSec teams to define secure policies and gain transparency over private key usage.

		<h2>Staying secure and agile</h2>
		<p>
			Frequent software releases and updates, the popularity of microservices as well as a stricter enforcement of internal security measures have increased the complexity for code signing. SignPath is made for developers from one of the leading European software development companies for government institutions. We automate security best practices to keep your development process agile.

					<h3>DevOps teams</h3>
					<p>
						SignPath provides secure code signing processes that directly integrate into existing continuous deployment (CD) pipelines. No hassle with installing cryptographic service prociders (CSPs) or connecting USB tokens, just simple command line or API calls.

				<h3>Secure private keys</h3>
				<p>
					When your private keys are compromised, your reputation is at risk. Software vendors are an increasingly attractive target for hackers and cyber criminals as they can be used as an entrance point to gain access to the IT infrastructure of the consumer's organizations, often unnoticed.

				<i class='la la-check-circle-o header'></i>
				<h3>Transparent processes</h3>
				<p>
					Securing your private key on a USB token or on a Hardware Security Module (HSM) is not enough. You need to restrict and monitor private key usage and ensure that only legitimate code is being signed.
