				<h2>Magical Tool</h2>
				<p>
					Microsoft Office Macros are a very usefull tool to automate workflows in your documents and do boring repetetive tasks very quickly. <br/>
					<br/>
					You also can interconnect the different Microsoft Office applications together and create unique user experiences for you and your collegues. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Immense Pain</h2>
				<p>
					Macros are programs within Office documents that <b>execute with the same permissions as the user</b> opening the document. <br/>
					That makes Office macros a preferred way for hackers to get into organizations, with attacks ranging from <b>ransomware</b> to <b>spear phishing</b>.<br/>
					Administrators find it <b>almost impossible to provide policy settings</b> that define which macros may be executed

		<p>
			In SignPath all your organization's code signing certificates are centrally managed. The InfoSec teams have full control over what code is signed and which certificate was used. They can view the entire history in case of an incident and define clear policies to restrict how each certificate may be used. SignPath allows you to import your own certificates or create a certificate signing request (CSR) for your certificate authority (CA). You are also notified on time before your certificate expires.
