## Abstract

The artifact configuration describes the structure of the artifacts you want to sign. For simple artifacts, you can use predefined configurations to get started quickly. For signing several artifacts together, and for more complex artifacts, specify the structure of your artifact and provide signing directives using XML.

## Creating and editing artifact configurations

### Upload an artifact sample

Before you start creating an artifact configuration from scratch, we recommend that you upload an artifact sample first. SignPath will then analyze your sample and look for nested artifacts that can be signed. 

For non-trivial artifacts, you may want to edit the resulting artifact configuration: 

* It may contain signing instructions for files that you do not want to sign, such as third-party components.
* It may contain fixed strings, such as version numbers, that you want to replace with [wildcards](syntax#wildcards).
* It may have very similar sections that you want to unify using [`<directory>`](syntax#directory-element) elements and wildcards ([example](examples#signing-similar-directories-within-an-msi-file)).

### Create an artifact configuration

When you create a new project, a default artifact configuration will be added. To create additional artifact configurations, select the project and click **Add** in the **Artifact Configurations** section. In either case, you can

* select **Upload an artifact sample** and select an artifact file to have the artifact configuration generated
* select a **Ready to use artifact configuration**
* select one of the **Templates for custom artifact configurations** and edit the XML content
* select **Custom** and create an artifact configuration from scratch

### Edit an artifact configuration

To modify an existing artifact configuration, select a project, then select the artifact configuration you want to change, and then either

* select **Edit** to select pre-defined artifact configurations or edit the XML content
* select **Update from an artifact sample** to generate your artifact configuration from a sample file

When you edit XML content in place, a graphical representation will be rendered immediately. If you prefer to use code completion, select **Download XML schema** and use a schema-aware XML editor, such as Microsoft Visual Studio.

Read more about projects and artifact configurations in [Setting up Projects](/documentation/projects).

## Signing multiple files 

You can easily sign multiple files by creating a ZIP archive. Use wildcards, individual file declarations or file sets to define structure and signing directives.

## Deep signing of nested files

Sometimes you need to sign both the container and its contents. For instance, an MSI installer package needs to be signed, but you also want the files it installs to be signed. SignPath can sign both the container and its contents in a single pass if you specify an appropriate artifact configuration. See [here](examples#msi-sample) for an example.
