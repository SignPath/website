Do you like to research and implement tailor-made security measures? Are comprehensive security audits part of your DNA? Then we have got an interesting offer for you right in the heart of Vienna. You can contribute to the success of a high-security IT scale-up and help us to prevent cyber attacks.

## About us

SignPath is a code signing scale-up providing a Software-as-a-Service platform and an enterprise software. Our customers are tech companies as well as enterprises developing their own software, scripts and macros. Our low- to mid-end customers appreciate the ease of use our SaaS service brings, with a high level of security even at the entry stage. Our enterprise customers benefit from additional integration, management and security features. These security sensitive customers rely on our experience with secure build chains in zero-trust environments.

Recent security incidents in the field of supply chains and increasing regulation drive interest in our unique solutions. To further secure our code and infrastructure we are looking for a part-time Junior IT Security Engineer (15-25 hours/week) who supports our security team.

* Knowledge of security technologies and principles
* Experience in at least one higher level programming language (e.g. Java, .NET, python)
* Independent and structured work style

## We offer

* Diverse and interesting security topics
* High degree of freedom to shape your team's and your own working style
* Up to 100% remote work, flat hierarchies, and flexible working hours
