**SignPath, the leading provider of advanced code signing solutions and build protection, will boost and expand the market going activities. With this move, SignPath also grows its leadership team.**

It’s official now: SignPath, based in Vienna, Austria, has been fully independent since the end of 2023. The company was initially founded in 2017 as a subsidiary of RUBICON IT GmbH, a leading European software development company.

In order to position itself more broadly as supplier of code integrity and SW supply chain security and to enter the international market more strongly, SignPath expanded its management team with the beginning of 2024:

**CEO Stefan Wenig** will continue to lead the positioning, product strategy and thought leadership within the company. Stefan has more than 25 years of experience as a software architect and development manager in the IT industry.

New to the management team is **Chief Sales Officer (CSO) Stephan Brack**. Stephan has wide ranging experience in positioning and selling security products with his own company Protected Networks. He will focus on growing and supporting the sales and reseller team. He will also establish the relevant content activities to support customers and teams.

**Chief Product Officer (CPO) Paul Savoie** will strengthen SignPath’s leadership position in the growing market of application security and code integrity. Paul has been with SignPath since 2018. He will use his experience as an entrepreneur and product designer to build on and expand the vision of SignPath to address current and future security challenges.

"I am excited that we can now start the new year at full speed to expand and optimize our product portfolio," says SignPath CEO Stefan Wenig. "We’ll continue to drive forward our zero-trust vision in software production and thus ensure greater security in the entire IT environment."
