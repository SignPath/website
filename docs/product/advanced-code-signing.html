	SignPath Advanced Code Signing streamlines and secures the code signing process by handling complex cryptographic tasks, ensuring the correct implementation, and relieving project teams of the burden of using platform-specific signing tools. It enforces central security policies, maintains detailed logging, and protects against attacks, allowing development teams to focus on flexibility while providing security teams the control they need. With deep integration into CI systems, SignPath safeguards code integrity without requiring teams to worry about potential vulnerabilities or policy violations.

		<h2>Secure storage of private keys</h2>
		<h3 class='subtitle'>Rest assured that your private keys can never be compromised</h3>
		<p>
			SignPath provides a FIPS-certified Hardware Security Module (HSM) to generate and store the private keys for your certificates. The HSM is located in a physically secured data center. Every signing operation takes place on the HSM ensuring that the private key is never exposed. The key infrastructure of SignPath fulfills all requirements for Extended Validation (EV) certificates without having to deal with USB tokens or spending money on dedicated hardware.

		<h2>Origin verification</h2>
		<h3 class='subtitle'>Trace every binary back to its source code</h3>
		<p>
			SignPath integrates with build servers and allows you to securely track the origin of your binary artifacts. The signed software releases can be linked to a specific commit in your source code repository, allowing you to reliably and securely pin down which code was shipped and who made changes to it.
