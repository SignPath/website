					The SignPath Code Signing Gateway offers a flexible extension to a full-featured code signing service. It is designed to support migration scenarios, where existing build scripts contain embedded signing steps. It is also useful in scenarios with limited bandwidth, where hash digests can be transferred instead of full packages. It allows tools to interact directly with the build environment and signing keys when needed, while supporting crypto APIs across Windows, Linux and MacOS. The Gateway supports quick migration and customization for unique workflows, giving customers control over their signing processes while balancing security with operational needs.

		<h2>Certificate management</h2>
		<h3>Don't hassle with USB tokens or HSM setups</h3>
		<p>
			In SignPath all your organization's code signing certificates are centrally managed. The InfoSec teams have full control over what code is signed and which certificate was used. They can view the entire history in case of an incident and define clear policies to restrict how each certificate may be used. SignPath allows you to import your own certificates or create a certificate signing request (CSR) for your certificate authority (CA). You are also notified on time before your certificate expires.

		<h2>Rapid Onboarding and Migration</h2>
		<h3>Take control over your code signing process</h3>
		<p>
			SignPath enables development teams to stay agile by allowing them to automate the code signing process as long as they stay within the boundaries of their organization's policies. Administrators can define which kind of software may be signed, who is allowed to submit a signing request and how many approvers must authorize it before it is signed. Additionally, SignPath offers origin verification, which ensures that a software artifact was built from a specific commit in your source code repository.

		<h2>Fast, reliable signing operations</h2>
		<h3>Sign executables and libraries within your installers and packages</h3>
		<p>
			Signing the installer or library package alone means that the software installed on your customer's systems is not digitally secured any more once the shipped installer has been unpacked and disposed. In order to continously ensure the authenticity and integrity of your software components, SignPath signs all files within the installation package and then automatically repackages the installer and signs the entire package.

		<h3>Automate your code signing process</h3>
		<p>
			Software development processes are increasingly automated to cope with the demand for more agility and frequent releases. SignPath allows code signing to be part of the build pipeline by providing a modern API, third party integrations and tools for seamless CI integration.

		<h2>Malware scanning of artifacts</h2>
		<h3 class='subtitle'>Know that there's another layer of security</h3>
		<p>
			All artifacts you upload to SignPath are checked for malware. Even if your build server is infected, SignPath adds an additional barrier to prevent shipping viruses to your users and customers.

		<h2>Secure storage of private keys</h2>
		<h3 class='subtitle'>Rest assured that your private keys can never be compromised</h3>
		<p>
			SignPath provides a FIPS-certified Hardware Security Module (HSM) to generate and store the private keys for your certificates. The HSM is located in a physically secured data center. Every signing operation takes place on the HSM ensuring that the private key is never exposed. The key infrastructure of SignPath fulfills all requirements for Extended Validation (EV) certificates without having to deal with USB tokens or spending money on dedicated hardware.

		<p>
			SignPath integrates with build servers and allows you to securely track the origin of your binary artifacts. The signed software releases can be linked to a specific commit in your source code repository, allowing you to reliably and securely pin down which code was shipped and who made changes to it.
