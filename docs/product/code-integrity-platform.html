					Relieves teams of tedious tasks, while guaranteeing correct implantation, provides authoritative logging and retention, and provides additional capabilities to harden the process against policy violations or attacks. SignPath automatically enforces well-defined policies and is easy to integrate into build processes. The deep security analysis that goes into each supported CI system ensures that development teams donâ€™t have to think about all the ways that integrity can go wrong, through sloppiness, mistakes, or attacks.

		<h2><b>What Challenges does the Code Integrity Platform address?</b></h2>
		<div>
			<div>


<p>Increasingly sophisticated attacks aim directly at software production, distribution,
deployment, and update processes.</p>

<p>Without a zero-trust approach to these processes, there are many ways to violate code
integrity. Any breach of network boundaries or access to a user account or other credentials
can be the starting point of an attack. Disgruntled employees, external accounts with far-
reaching permissions or failure to deactivate these accounts, or simple social engineering can
be used to take over software releases.</p>

<p>Where security depends on carefulness and policy conformance, simple negligence can
lead to potentially catastrophic results. Paper policies that are hard to execute or get in the
way of agility and productivity cannot be relied upon.</p>

<p>As in every IT security discipline, defenders must be thorough, but attackers only need to
find a single way to succeed. However, the attack surface in software production is
unproportionally large.</p>

<p>The impact of code integrity violations is not limited to critical software. Any software can be
exploited beyond the scope of its original purpose if it runs on sensitive systems or has
access to sensitive data. And even seemingly harmless programs can be used to prepare
attacks using lateral movement or social engineering techniques.</p>

	<div class='description'>
		<h2>Certificate management</h2>
		<h3>Don't hassle with USB tokens or HSM setups</h3>
		<p>
			In SignPath all your organization's code signing certificates are centrally managed. The InfoSec teams have full control over what code is signed and which certificate was used. They can view the entire history in case of an incident and define clear policies to restrict how each certificate may be used. SignPath allows you to import your own certificates or create a certificate signing request (CSR) for your certificate authority (CA). You are also notified on time before your certificate expires.

		<h2>Policy enforcement</h2>
		<h3>Take control over your code signing process</h3>
		<p>
			SignPath enables development teams to stay agile by allowing them to automate the code signing process as long as they stay within the boundaries of their organization's policies. Administrators can define which kind of software may be signed, who is allowed to submit a signing request and how many approvers must authorize it before it is signed. Additionally, SignPath offers origin verification, which ensures that a software artifact was built from a specific commit in your source code repository.

		<h2>Deep signing of nested files</h2>
		<h3>Sign executables and libraries within your installers and packages</h3>
		<p>
			Signing the installer or library package alone means that the software installed on your customer's systems is not digitally secured any more once the shipped installer has been unpacked and disposed. In order to continously ensure the authenticity and integrity of your software components, SignPath signs all files within the installation package and then automatically repackages the installer and signs the entire package.

		<h2>Build integration</h2>
		<h3>Automate your code signing process</h3>
		<p>
			Software development processes are increasingly automated to cope with the demand for more agility and frequent releases. SignPath allows code signing to be part of the build pipeline by providing a modern API, third party integrations and tools for seamless CI integration.

	<div class='img'><div><img src='/assets/img/product/features/malware-scanning.png' title='Malware scanning' /></div></div>
	<div class='description'>
		<h2>Malware scanning of artifacts</h2>
		<h3 class='subtitle'>Know that there's another layer of security</h3>
		<p>
			All artifacts you upload to SignPath are checked for malware. Even if your build server is infected, SignPath adds an additional barrier to prevent shipping viruses to your users and customers.

	<div class='description'>
		<h2>Secure storage of private keys</h2>
		<h3 class='subtitle'>Rest assured that your private keys can never be compromised</h3>
		<p>
			SignPath provides a FIPS-certified Hardware Security Module (HSM) to generate and store the private keys for your certificates. The HSM is located in a physically secured data center. Every signing operation takes place on the HSM ensuring that the private key is never exposed. The key infrastructure of SignPath fulfills all requirements for Extended Validation (EV) certificates without having to deal with USB tokens or spending money on dedicated hardware.

		<h2>Origin verification</h2>
		<h3 class='subtitle'>Trace every binary back to its source code</h3>
		<p>
			SignPath integrates with build servers and allows you to securely track the origin of your binary artifacts. The signed software releases can be linked to a specific commit in your source code repository, allowing you to reliably and securely pin down which code was shipped and who made changes to it.
