> **Sharing operational secrets**
>
> In case you need to share operational secrets with us, please encrypt them using our [public Operations GPG key](/assets/other/signpath_ops_gpg_public_key.asc). If you don't have GPG tooling installed, you can use the [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/encrypt#signpath_ops) service (encryption is performed on the client).
